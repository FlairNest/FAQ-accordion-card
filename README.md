5. What I learned:

	For several days we did the challenge from Mentor.  When creating this site, we used html, css and js.  In the course of execution, we acquired programming skills.  In particular, we have improved the skills in the style of css.  Using such a volume of elements was quite difficult to control each one, but our skills helped us a lot.  We also learned how to manage js.  This 	is the second job with js, so in the course of writing and studying, we acquired a lot of skills and knowledge.  First, it is a directive for years.  The let directive declares a block-	scoped variable with the ability to initialize it with a value.  Secondly, these are different parameters.  For example, a listener object that receives notification when an event of the  specified type has occurred.  It must be an object that implements the EventListener interface, or just a JavaScript function.  Also the generation (children) of elements for easier control 	and management of (transform) elements using degrees.
